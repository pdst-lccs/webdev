Ever since tasting these      eggs on my 1<sup>st</sup> visit to Bill's restaurant in Kings Cross, Sydney,      I have been after the recipe. I have since transformed it into what      I really believe are the <em>best</em> scrambled eggs I have ever tasted.</p>    <p>This recipe is what I call a <q>very special breakfast</q>;      just look at the ingredients to see why. It has to be tasted to be      believed.</p>  <h2>Ingredients</h2>    <p>The following ingredients make one serving:</p>      <ul>        <li>2 eggs</li>        <li>1 tablespoon of butter (10g)</li>        <li>1/3 cup of cream <i>(2 3/4 fl ounces)</i></li>        <li>A pinch of salt</li>        <li>Freshly milled black pepper</li>        <li>3 fresh chives (chopped)</li>      </ul>  <h2>Instructions</h2>      <ol>        <li>Whisk eggs, cream, and salt in a bowl.</li>        <li>Melt the butter in a non-stick pan over a high heat <i>(taking care not          to burn the butter)</i>.</li>        <li>Pour egg mixture into pan and wait until it starts setting around the          edge of the pan (around 20 seconds).</li>        <li>Using a wooden spatula, bring the mixture into the center as if it were          an omelet, and let it cook for another 20 seconds.</li>        <li>Fold contents in again, leave for 20 seconds, and repeat until the eggs          are only just done.</li>        <li>Grind a light sprinkling of freshly milled pepper over the eggs          and blend in some chopped fresh chives.</li>      </ol>    <p>You should only make a <strong>maximum</strong> of two servings per frying      pan.</p>  </body></html>
